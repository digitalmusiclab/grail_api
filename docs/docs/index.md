# Purpose

The General Recorded Audio Identity Linker (GRAIL) is a music metadata ID linking API that: verifies and links music metadata IDs by means of a set of strict criteria, confirms linkage consistency using continuous crawling of music-service APIs, and provides ID linkages as a free, publicly available resource.

The motivation of GRAIL is to facilitate research within music by providing as many openly available music-entity linkages as possible. 

# Objectives
The purpose of GRAIL is to:</br>

1. Maintain transparency by providing detailed documentation of data collection, and validation process</br>
2. Can assign mulitple IDs to a single entity</br>
3. Prioritizes correct, complete, and consistent linkages</br>
4. Does not depend upon ontologies of existing services</br>
5. Is a free, open-access service for the music research community</br>
6. Continually to searches, and links resources</br>

# Linkage Results and Services
To date, more than 30 million tracks, 2.7 million releases (albums), and 28 million artists IDs have been ingested into GRAIL, making it possibly one of the largest open-access music metadata resources available to date.
