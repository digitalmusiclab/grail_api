# Solr+Flask based API 
Testing approaches for a Flask+SolR-based API

## SolR instance running in OS X (10.10.5)

```
brew install solr
solr create -c grail  # create core named grail
mv schema.xml ./solr/grail/conf # move the schema into the conf folder in the running solr server
post -c grail ./grail_10_rows.csv  # load data in CSV format in core named grail
```
Test Solr install and data loading
```
curl http://localhost:8983/solr/grail/select\?indent\=on\&q\=\*:\*\&wt\=json
```
Should return a JSON file with the number of entries in the loaded file


## Adding a webserver layer with Flash

Resources:
- RESTful API: http://blog.luisrei.com/articles/flaskrest.html
- RESTful Auth with Flask: http://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/restful-authentication-with-flask

```
pip install flask
python api.py
```

Users are add via POSTmessages
```
curl -i -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"username":"joe","password":"changeme"}' http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/users
```

If token-based authentication is wanted

```
curl -u joe:changeme -i -X GET http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/token
```

Returns a JSON file with the token, which expires in 10 minutes

Then, typing in the terminal: 
```
curl -u joe:changeme -i -X GET http://127.0.0.1:5000/api?artist_name=Mansun
curl -u joe:changeme -i -X GET http://127.0.0.1:5000/api?isrc=GBAYE0000395
```
or 
```
curl -u eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsImV4cCI6MTQ2NTk5OTMzMiwiaWF0IjoxNDY1OTk4NzMyfQ.eyJpZCI6Mn0.Np5aovCNHOYO3i0r36KTgGWj-k_z8TUOpebwWuyT_cw:unused -i -X GET http://127.0.0.1:5000/api?isrc=GBAYE0000395
```

Will return a JSON file with the entries belonging to the artist Mansun, and the artist with the corresponding ISRC. In the previous call example, the token is passed as a username, and there is no need for password (that is why 'unused' appears in that field)
